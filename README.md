README TEAM 4: VISUALIZATION
Work on a dataset of Glassdoor- Analyze Gender Pay Gap.

INTRODUCTION
The data set has been taken from glassdoor and focuses on income for various job titles based on gender. As there have been many studies showing that women are paid less than men for the same job titles, this data set will be helpful in identifying the depth of the gender-based pay gap. Tableau has been used to visualize this data.
